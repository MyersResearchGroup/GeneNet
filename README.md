The GeneNet algorithm is used to learn genetic regulatory network connectivity from experimental data. It exploits
the time series nature of experimental data to allow for better causal predictions on
networks with tight feedback.

## Installing GeneNet
### From source:
If you want to compile GeneNet from source, simply run:

```make```

This will create a binary called GeneNet.

### From user-interface:
Another option is to install [iBioSim](https://github.com/MyersResearchGroup/iBioSim).

This options is recommended for beginners because the settings are generated automatically.

For further information on how to use the learn view, refer to the [tutorial](http://www.async.ece.utah.edu/tools/BioSim/docs/iBioSim_SysBio_Tutorial.html#tth_sEc8).
