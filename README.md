The GeneNet algorithm is used to learn genetic regulatory network connectivity from experimental data. It exploits
the time series nature of experimental data to allow for better causal predictions on
networks with tight feedback.

## Installing GeneNet
### From source:
If you want to compile GeneNet from source, simply run:

```make```

This will create a binary called GeneNet in the ```GeneNet/bin``` directory.
